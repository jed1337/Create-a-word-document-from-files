# Create a Word Document From Files

## Information
This program automates the process of creating a word containing the file names of files in a given path.

We separate the information depending on if the script is a normal script or a verification script. Verification scripts are scripts under a folder called "verification".

## Assumptions
We assume that all the files in the given path are scripts.

The path can contain sub directories within it.
